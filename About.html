<p> I am an undergraduate of Mathematics Education at Federal University Oye Ekiti.</p>
<p>Hobbies: Playing games,Surfing the Internet,Eating, watching intresting<br> 
 Movies,and Coding.</p>
 <p> After i got admission into school that was when the pandanmic issue began and i came home from school<br> 
    and had to continue the work i was learning before going to school, but the pandemic did not give us<br>
    chance to go out for about four month,during that period i went to my uncle place to learn computer repair<br>
    (but not perfect though).At a time i stopped going (because i can't stay broke na, I need to earn money)<br>
    After then the pandemic was over and we resume back to school. 
    <p>  This year again ASUU brought their own (Wahala) the work i was learning am already getting tired of it<br>
    So a Sister like a friend of mine asked me if i was interested in earning Tech and sure I was interested <br> 
    because have been looking for the opporunity and I decided to go for it.So i enrolled in<br>
    Code Learn Grow(CLG) Which is a Starting point for aspiring developers.But while i was learning i<br> 
    found out that it was very interesting and slowly i was strivng to Learn more and while coding <br>
    if i find anything difficult  I check on google,W3school, Youtube or I ask my tutors or collegues<br>
