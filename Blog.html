    <p class="container2">Since I started this Tech Journey I realised that when you are consistent in doing<br>
        something you become better and you learn different ways of doing it,and also be determined<br>
        to get better and be opened minded to learn new things. Even when feel things are not going as <br>
        planned,you have to keep trying.
